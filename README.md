# AcroYoga Flow App
- [Live App](https://acroyoga-flow.vercel.app/)
- [API Repo](https://github.com/ZenMnky/acroyoga-flow-api)

## Description


### Summary
- ðŸŽ¯ Primary goal of the app:
    - Help AcroYoga practitioners develop a flow by allowing users to Create, Save, and Share (via url) an AcroYoga sequence that is comprised of position images and the position names (aka 'acroyoga elements')

- ðŸŽ¯ Other goals of this project:
    - Quickly satisfy the project requirements provided by Thinkful and thereby fully complete the coursework
        - This goal was achieved by separating desired features from minimum viable product features, and focusing on the core essence of the project idea.
    - Have an [interactive flow creation feature](https://acroyoga-flow.vercel.app/create/flow) - something that feels more physically engaging than just clicking on a list of items
        - This goal was achieved by using [React-Beautiful-DnD](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-beautiful-dnd), a library designed specifically for adding a sense of natural movement to lists of items
    - Learn some new things
        - This project was developed in a time crunch, so I had to be very thoughtful about choosing what I wanted to learn.
        - I chose to go with: 
            - [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) for history, state, context, and component lifecycle functions
                - // So much cleaner and easier to work with, compared to stateful class components and with deeply nested consumers
            - [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
                - // Allows the use of vanilla css in a very simple, clean way. No more css modules, no more messy class names.

- A note on design
    - I chose to focus on learning to use [React-Beautiful-DnD](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-beautiful-dnd), [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), and [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) rather than spend a bunch of time focusing on flashy styling.
